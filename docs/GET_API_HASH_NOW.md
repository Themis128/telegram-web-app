# Get Your API Hash Now - Manual Method

## ⚠️ Tool Issue

The automated tool has a bug. Let's use the **manual method** which is more reliable!

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Get Your API Hash

### Step 1: Open Telegram API Portal

1. **Open your browser**
2. **Go to:** https://my.telegram.org/apps
3. **Log in** with your phone: `+306977777838`

### Step 2: Enter Verification Code

1. You'll receive a code in your Telegram app
2. **Enter the code** on the website (like you did with the tool: `Z7YgzQBgznf`)

### Step 3: View Your Application

Once logged in, you should see:

**If you already have an application:**
- You'll see your existing app with:
  - **App api_id:** `7017840434` ✅ (you have this!)
  - **App api_hash:** `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` ← **COPY THIS!**

**If you need to create one:**
1. Click **"Create application"** or **"Create new application"**
2. Fill in:
   - **App title:** `MCP Telegram Server` (or any name)
   - **Short name:** `mcp` (or any short name)
   - **Platform:** Choose "Desktop" or "Other"
   - **Description:** (optional, can leave empty)
3. Click **"Create"**
4. You'll see your **api_id** and **api_hash**

### Step 4: Copy Your API Hash

- The **api_hash** is a long string (32 characters)
- It looks like: `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6`
- **Copy the entire hash**

## After Getting Your API Hash

### Update .env File

1. Open: `D:\Nuxt Projects\telegram\.env`
2. Replace `YOUR_API_HASH_HERE` with your actual API Hash
3. Save

### Update Cursor Settings

1. Open: `C:\Users\baltz\AppData\Roaming\Cursor\User\settings.json`
2. Add the MCP configuration (see `WHERE_TO_CONFIGURE.md`)
3. Use your API Hash in the configuration
4. Save

### Restart Cursor

1. Close Cursor completely
2. Reopen Cursor
3. Authenticate when prompted
