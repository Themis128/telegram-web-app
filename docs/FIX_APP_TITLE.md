# Fix: "Incorrect app name!" Error

## ❌ The Problem

The error "Incorrect app name!" is likely about the **App title** field, not the short name.

Your current **App title** is just `server` which might be:
- Too short
- Too generic
- Not descriptive enough

## ✅ The Solution

Change your **App title** to something more descriptive:

### Option 1 (Recommended):
```
MCP Telegram Server
```

### Option 2:
```
Telegram MCP Integration
```

### Option 3:
```
My Telegram MCP App
```

### Option 4:
```
Cursor Telegram MCP
```

## 📝 Complete Corrected Form
