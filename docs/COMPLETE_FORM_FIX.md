# Complete Form Fix - Add URL Too!

## ✅ Fix Both Issues

### 1. Fix Short Name (REQUIRED)
Change from `mcp` (3 chars) to:
```
mcp-server
```
(Must be 5-32 characters!)

### 2. Add URL (May Help)
Add this URL:
```
https://github.com/dryeab/mcp-telegram
```

Or if you prefer:
```
https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers
```

Or even simpler:
```
https://telegram.org
```

## 💡 Why This Might Help

- **Short name** being too short is definitely the main issue
- **URL** might be required or help with validation
- Having both filled out makes the form more complete
